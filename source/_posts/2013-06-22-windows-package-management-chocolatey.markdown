Recently discovered [Chocolatey](http://chocolatey.org/), which I'll be using for basic software installation on new machines.

Chocolatey both suffers and benefits from its community-driven packages. While there are a large number of packages available, especially compared to similar windows tools, several packages I tried are were not functioning and seem abandoned.

My current install script and package lists can be found [here](https://github.com/Billiam/chocolate-setup).
